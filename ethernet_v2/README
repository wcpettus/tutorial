This tutorial is designed to integrate the fake ethernet device into a dripline service.
For dripline we need two additional core services: the broker and the scpi-service; I've added an additional dripline service just for functionality.
The fake device works identically to the v1 tutorial, but if you try the same functionality as last time, you will discover some things broke.
